Today's affordable astro-imaging capable digital single-lens-reflex cameras (DSLRs), the growing power of personal computers, and the proliferation of telescopes and imaging accessories has brought imaging capabilities within the reach of practically every amateur astronomer - and this second edition of the Handbook plus AIP4Win 2.0 is ready, willing, and able to assist every observer in making great astronomical images.  In the Handbook, we amplified the original chapters on astronomical equipment and imaging techniques, revised our discussions of astrometry and photometry to reflect the steady growth in these scientific fields, and expanded tutorials in the back of the book to help you get up to speed quickly.  On the accompanying CDROM (found on the inside back cover) you will find hundreds of megabytes of sample images you can use to learn techniques such as image registration and stacking that guarantee good results even from those living with suburban and urban skies.

"0151004714","The Last Life: A Novel","Claire Messud's piercing second novel asks questions most are too fearful to face. Moving between the South of France, the East Coast of the U.S., and Algeria, <i>The Last Life</i> explores the weight of isolation and exile in one French family. Of course, the adjective <i>French</i> is already inadequate, as at least some of the LaBasses still long for the paradise lost of Algeria. And Alex LaBasse's wife, Carol, try as she might with her Continental impersonations, will always be an American sporting a metaphorical twin set. The narrator, Sagesse, too, soon finds herself equally stranded. Only her autocratic grandfather, Jacques, is ostensibly comfortable with the identity he has wrought: successful owner of the Bellevue Hotel and head of his dynasty. It is thanks to this man that 14-year-old Sagesse comes to crave invisibility. Having lost of all of her friends, she sees herself as ""a member of the Witness Protection Program, surrounded by an odd human assortment chosen only for the efficiency of disguise; but somehow, nevertheless, inescapable.""",,"Books","Visit Amazon's Claire Messud Page"
"0151014841","Lady Lazarus","In this gleeful, difficult debut, Altschul lays into an easy target&mdash;cynical celebrity culture&mdash;and meticulously crafts an over-the-top pop mirror world for his young heroine. Leaning heavily on the star mythology of Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love and their daughter, Frances Bean, Altschul introduces Calliope Bird Morath, the most famous poet in America, beloved to deconstructionists and culture theorists and fifteen-year-old girls alike. Calliope's childhood, revealed in retrospect, is haunted by a public fascination with her parents, mercurial rock 'n' roll heroes Brandt Morath and Penny Power, a fascination continuing long after Brandt's suicide when Calliope is a small child. Pushed by the demanding Penny to claim her father's destiny, Calliope skips college to attend a prestigious M.F.A. program, and soon publishes a collection of poems that centers on Brandt's death and sounds a lot like bad Sylvia Plath. The media swarms, and Calliope scandalizes&mdash;and perhaps really does find a path back to her father after all. Over the course of nearly 600 pages, Altschul registers some razor-sharp cultural observations and executes some thrilling high dives (the character named Andrew Altschul's sessions with a Lacanian analyst in particular). But the book's tricky PoMo narrative is bloated with gee-whiz grad-schoolisms, and storytelling takes a backseat to indulgence throughout. <I>(Apr.)</I> <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is new to town, with no father, a perpetually weary mother, and a four-year-old sister, Sandy, who has polio. Sandy's greatest pleasure is for Whitey to read to her The Littlest Angel and, more than anything else, she wants an ""Angel"" doll for Christmas, just like the one in the story. Whitey, his hard-won friend (the narrator of the story), and other members of the small community work together to give the child her wish. It is the story of their efforts and the results that are the basis of this Christmas tale. Told matter-of-factly, the story is evocative of a time and a place, and has great appeal to readers of all ages.?Pamela B.

"0312331363","Scared Money","Edgar-finalist Hime's overly complicated sequel to his well-received <I>The Night of the Dance</I> (2003) pits ex-Texas Ranger Jeremiah Spur and black Deputy Sheriff Clyde Thomas against competing drug cartels in racially charged Brenham, Tex. In separate plots that fill more than 70 mini-chapters, Thomas investigates a drug-related double murder while Spur searches for Edwin ""Dusty"" Nelson, an accountant who may have absconded with $10 million from Benjamin Farkas, a Hungarian refugee and local real estate tycoon haunted by flashbacks of the Soviet invasion of his homeland nearly 50 years earlier. Vengeance, greed and fear drive characters through myriad scene changes from rural Texas to Mexico City to Vienna, and ""scared money"" becomes a metaphor for those on the lam, pursued for the wealth that cocaine and heroin peddling can bring in the dreary ethnic neighborhoods of the Southwest. After numerous police meetings, the pieces finally begin to fit together as Spur and Thomas join forces to work on what prove to be overlapping cases. This searing tale ends on a hopeful note, but not before lots of blood has been spilled on two continents. <BR>Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"0312364415","A Stranger Lies There","In Santogrossi's engrossing, dark debut (winner of the St. Martin's Press/Malice Domestic contest for Best First Traditional Mystery Novel), the curiously endearing protagonist, Tim Ryder, wakes up one morning to find a dead body on his Palm Springs, Calif., lawn. Ryder, a carpenter, wonders if the murder is connected to testimony he gave against a co-conspirator in a criminal case 30 years earlier, when he did time for a bungled robbery, a misguided attempt to raise money for antiVietnam War protests. With the next current-day casualty, the matter becomes more urgent, and even more personal, and Tim is determined to find the killer. On occasion, Santogrossi veers off into preachy description, breaking the cardinal show-don't-tell rule, but his well-drawn characters, unexpected resolution and sharp casual insights make for an energizing read. <i>(May)</i> <br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"0373250460","You Have to Kiss a Lot of Frogs","Disguised as yet another chick-lit novel about disastrous dating, this book moves beyond genre constraints to offer a provocative and intelligent look at the ways that people search for a meaningful life. Cleverly titled chapters such as ""Weight Listed"" and ""A Clue in Time Saves Nine"" describe actress Karrie Kline's dating adventures, but there's a continuity in her narration that makes this novel more than the sum of its parts. Several themes recur throughout, including Karrie's admiration for her mother and stepfather's marriage and her relationship to Judaism, and though romance may come hard to Karrie, her love for New York City is constant, even when she briefly expatriates to Los Angeles. While Karrie's dates are truly hilarious-like the man who wears the same outfit every day, and the man who barks like a dog to show affection-there's also a sense of poignancy as Kerrie truly attempts to give each man his due. Her dates wind through the decades, tracing history as they do, and what's left when the laughter dies down is a normal woman looking for a normal type of happiness, but one who passes by her lucky break like a ship in the night. Those expecting a light and fluffy confection will likely be pleasantly surprised by this more substantive fare. <br />Copyright  Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"0375503757","What She Saw...: A Novel","Sometimes in a moment of limbo or confusion, it's advisable to make a list. An inventory of accomplishments, a chart of pros and cons.

Later, in college, it's ""Humphrey Fung, or 'The Anarchist Feminist.'""

"0375505458","A Collection of Beauties at the Height of Their Popularity: A Novel","Set in San Francisco in the 1980s, <i>A Collection of Beauties at the Height of Their Popularity</i> is a novel of late youth--the final indulgences and excesses of a group of friends before paths are chosen, before character is set. Whitney Otto (<i><a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345370805/${0}"">How to Make an American Quilt</a></i>) takes as her inspiration the floating world depicted in Japanese prints of the Edo period. Her characters, most of them denizens of the Youki Singe Tea Room in North Beach, live in the moment. They are unambitious, minimally employed, well-educated, and self-indulgent. Dreamers of various kinds, the women (who have artful names like Jelly, Coco, Gracie, and Theo) are passionate about their friendships, their parties, and their appearance. The narrative is as fluid as the characters, sometimes delivering a perfectly formed short story about a minor figure, and other times tracing back to explain a pivotal high school incident. Readers who give themselves over to this flowing story line, and to the shifting array of characters, will find this a rewarding and oddly moving novel. <i>A Collection of Beauties</i> perfectly evokes a particular mood of watchfulness, as its characters wait for their world to form around them. <i>--Regina Marler</i>",,"Books","Visit Amazon's Whitney Otto Page"
"0380709473","Crows Can't Count","Yet another complex whodunit starring Donald Lamb, the pint-sized detective with the big brain and his outsized, money-loving business partner Bertha Cool. Beginning with an innocuous inquiry into a hocked pendent, the pace picks up fairly fast with an unexpected murder, the mysterious appearance of dazzling precious gems, and of all the unusual characters, a pet crow with a penchant for glittering objects. In almost Bond style, the scene shifts to Colombia with its twisting mountain roads, steamy jungles, gold and gem mines, and an inscrutable and menacing police chief. Unraveling tortuous plots is Donalds specialty, and this one is no different. An exciting read, and for those used to Earle Stanley Gardeners Perry Mason with his perspicacity and trained legal mind, Gardner in his A.A. Fair avatar, sketches his protagonist Donald Lamb very differently. Also trained as a lawyer and no less sharp-witted than Mason, yet a total contrast.",,"Books","Erle Stanley Gardner"
"0380812916","Tokyo Suckerpunch : A Billy Chaka Adventure","This pop romp through the Tokyo of martial arts, yakuza and legendary geishas has more sly smarts than a Hong Kong gangster shoot-'em-up. First-time novelist Adamson hooks the reader with fast action, clever dialogue and all-over atmosphere, while complicating the plot mightily and implausibly. Billy Chaka is a popular columnist for the Cleveland mag Youth in Asia. He's come to Tokyo to cover the 19 and Under Handicapped International Martial Arts Championship. While Chaka is waiting in a bar for the arrival of his old friend filmmaker Sato Migusho, an apparently drunken woman enters and rushes for the ladies' room. Immediately recognizing her as a geisha in disguise, on the lam from disgruntled clients, ChakaDwho has a weakness for geishasDhelps her escape and handles the tough guys with some dandy kickboxing moves. After Chaka learns that Sato has died in a seemingly accidental fire at his secret luxury hideout, the Garden of Earthly Delights, he ducks his reporterly duties and sets out to find the geisha. While on this quest, underwritten by a yakuza leader named Kwaidan and an unnamed religious cult, Chaka keeps stumbling over imponderables in the Sato case, including the news that Sato was about to film an unauthorized version of Chaka's own life, entitled Tokyo Suckerpunch. This novel is all speed and no depth, but that's forgivable in a narration that detours around such marvelous (and doubtful) Japanese pop esoterica as current fashions in Japanese motorcycle gangs and the tape-recorded politesse of Japanese vending machines.

The 30-something's quiet, tidy life is turned upside-down when her boss asks her to temporarily take in a foul-mouthed teen runaway named Sienna. During this stint as a foster mom, Tamara has to supervise homework, discuss teenage sexuality and wade into the murky world of pop culture. She is also motivated to put together some of the pieces of her own interrupted childhood and travels to prisons and hospitals in search of birth parents she never knew. Edwards richly develops the novel's characters, especially those who play supporting parts. Tamara's outrageous friend and colleague, Lynette, is a hoot, and Lynette and Tamara's sharply dressed but racist boss is well drawn. Still, the novel is far from perfect. The two plotsTamara and Sienna's relationship, and Tamara's own childhoodtie together at the end, but the connections require coincidences that strain credulity.

"0575075996","The Runes of the Earth : The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant","In 1977, Stephen Donaldson changed the face of epic fantasy. With the publication of THE CHRONICLES OF THOMAS COVENANT THE UNBELIEVER, Donaldson created a true phenomenon: an epic fantasy instant bestseller that has gone on to sell millions. The 'hero', Thomas Covenant, is mysteriously struck down with a disease believed eradicated; he is abandoned by his wife and young son and becomes a pariah. Alone and despairing, Covenant falls - and is drawn into a mysterious new world, where gentle people work magic and the earth itself brings healing. He is welcomed as the reincarnation of a legendary saviour, but Covenant refuses to believe; he's convinced he's having delusions. At the end of the sixth book, as Covenant battles to save the world, he is killed - in both worlds - as Dr Linden Avery, his horrified companion, looks on. Now comes the book every fantasy reader has been waiting for. It's ten years later, and Linden Avery thought she would never see the Land, or Covenant, her beloved, again. But Lord Foul has stolen her adopted son, and is unmaking the very laws of nature. And though she believes Covenant dead, he keeps sending Linden messages: 'Find me', and 'You're the only one who can do this' and 'Remember that I'm dead'. The Land is in turmoil, and Lord Foul has plans for them all ...",,"Books","Stephen Donaldson"
"0575074205","Fat (Gollancz)","Rob Grant's new novel is a revelation. After INCOMPETENCE we would all have expected a killingly funny satire. And in its satire of our obsession with body image, of how the media makes us what we are FAT is certainly that. But in its depiction of Grenville, a fat man at his wits end with the need to be thin; of Hayleigh, a teenage girl obsessed with her terror of being fat and of Jeremy, the self-absorbed, self-adoring 'conceptualist' employed to promote the government's new 'Fat Farms' Rob Grant has given us, yes a very, very funny book, but also an immensely moving and personal novel about how we all feel about our bodies. As Grenville deals with the humilation and daily indignity of being fat, as Hayleigh struggles to deal with her anorexia and as Jeremy comes to terms with the dangerous lies at the centre of the government's new health regime FAT takes us on a hilarious and thought-provoking journey through our all-consuming obession with fat. This is a hilariously moving, movingly hilarious novel and marks a massive step-change in Rob Grant's growth as a writer. Here is a hugely commerical new voice in mainstream, high concept, high in poly-saturates, commercial fiction. It's also safe to say that with this new novel, he's writing about what he knows ...",,"Books","Visit Amazon's Rob Grant Page"
