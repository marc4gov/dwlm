# Energy Directory Overview

## Project Context
The project focuses on comprehensive water management data collection, energy consumption analysis, and optimization of water systems to support sustainable water management strategies.

## Data Files

### Water Level (Waterpeil) CSVs
- `waterpeil_gouda.csv`
- `waterpeil_halfweg.csv`
- `waterpeil_katwijk.csv`

**Contents and Purpose:**
- Time-series data of water levels
- Columns likely include:
  * Timestamp
  * Water level measurements
  * Location-specific metadata
- Supports water management effectiveness analysis
- Tracks water level variations in different regions

### Discharge (Debiet) CSVs
- `debiet_gouda.csv` & `debiet_gouda_stripped.csv`
- `debiet_halfweg.csv` & `debiet_halfweg_stripped.csv`
- `debiet_katwijk.csv` & `debiet_katwijk_stripped.csv`

**Contents and Purpose:**
- Water flow/discharge measurements
- Columns likely include:
  * Timestamp
  * Water discharge volume
  * Flow rate
  * Location-specific details
- Stripped versions represent cleaned or processed data
- Enables analysis of:
  * Water movement in pumping stations
  * Energy consumption for water management
  * Water system optimization
